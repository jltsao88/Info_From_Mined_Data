Unlike one of the other clients, I have to say that I had great experience at my local lulu store the other night. Also, keep in mind that it is a new product for them and you always have to work out the kinks. These crops fit great when I originally tried them on in a store while out of town and the educator thought they fit perfect. I am 5'8"" and 154lbs. I wear a size 6 in all lulu bottoms until recently when I had to go a size up in a different crop. Anyway, I wore them once for Orange Theory and the lightweight material was awesome because their air was not working that day. I sweat like a pig, but you could not notice the sweat on these pants. I have the navy blue. BUT, the bottom of the legs were bunching up enough that you could not see the lulu logo and they expanded in the groin/pelvic area. I took them to my local store last night. It turns out that lulu made a newer version and it is noted by more vertical reflective dots near the bottom of the crop. I bought the original pair in late May. I tried mine on and the educators could definitely see that they had lost their shape. It could have been a design flaw. I tried on a new 6 and they felt great. I tried on a new 4 and they seemed to fit a bit more snug in the calves and around the waist. The educators were wonderful and exchanged my crops for a new pair in the size 4. They stuck by the belief that they want you to be satisfied and understand that these cost a lot of money. I could not have asked for better service because I never asked for an exchange. They offered it. This is why I love lulu. Those with poor customer service should speak with management at their local store. I used to work retail and you have to make your clients happy. I am super happy with the new crops. No problems whatsoever! Keep making more colors and patterns in the Nulux, especially dark colors!

macys126131239,APPAREL,4,,"First, big complaint you will see is the depth of the pockets. I actually agree the designers at UA with the shorter pockets in theory. That is, who honestly wants to shove their entire hand into their pockets on a hot day and go dig for a ball marker, tee or ball. Honestly, with plastic tees, you only need one the entire round. So, I totally agree with the depth for my style of play, in that I carry one ball marker, one plastic tee and a ball. This is a golf short and not a cargo short, so again I am a fan of the depth. If you carry lots of stuff and devices in your pockets, then you definitely need a different short. The fit is very good, conforming while flexible and of good quality. My only complaint, is the material used inside the pockets is not slick, which is needed for the shorter front sockets, but try getting a golf ball out of the rear pockets is impossible without completely turning the pocket inside out. The rear ""inside"" pocket material should be of slicker material and not the same material you use on the shorter front pockets.",Overall Very Good Golf Short,pos,1,pos,1,,0,,0,neg,1

The texture of the fabric is smooth and soft, made of 100% polyester comfy for baby. It’s so easy to wash all you have to do is to toss it to your washer with the gentle cycle mode and then tumble in the drier in the lowest mode. The reason for the 50% thumbs down is because of its poor quality regarding the stitches. Honestly, I saw a lot of knotted thread in the collar and under the arm part which is visible outside. I feel like it was rushed and stitched just to hold pieces of fabric together, disregarding the part where you have to check the quality of the hem and not only that but the knotted and loose threads.

walmart76743292,APPAREL,1,X,"DO NOT BUY!!! These were my favorite work jeans. I would buy 4 or 5 pair every 2-3 years. My latest purchase will be my last unless they fix the quality issues. Within weeks the pockets were ripping and after a few washes the material they use has started to rip. I bought 4 pair in different colors and they have all done the same thing. Lee please bring back the old materials, they were perfect for the working man.",What happened to durability?,,0,,0,neg,1,,0,neg,1

zappos4565582,APPAREL,2,X,"Cute and comfy but not for large busts if you need even an inkling of lift. I'm a 36DD and this bra just held my breasts still and and against my chest. Not necessarily a bad thing but if like I said, if you want ANy lift pass on this. It wasn't a waste for me, as sometimes I want a very minimized look - when I wear low cut, loose fitting tanks or tunics for example. It kind of pushes my boobs down and into my chest. I actually ordered it in two sizes because I wasn't sure and the smaller band size of course just flattened my boobs even more. I kept both and only wear them about twice a year. Wouldn't buy again.",,,0,pos,1,,0,pos,1,,0

zappos5361302,APPAREL,5,,"I'm 5'2"" with very large calf muscles from serious skiing and biking. I can't wear the longer bottoms as I'm too short with a 26"" inseam to west the longer bottoms, and more importantly, my calf muscles are too large to tuck the longer leggings into the boot. So I buy the shorter bootcut bottoms and they work perfectly for me. I've had mine for years and it still is holding its shape and fits well. I want more that one pair, so I plan on buying more soon, just for skiing, as I ski close to 50 days a season.",,pos,1,pos,1,pos,1,,0,,0
